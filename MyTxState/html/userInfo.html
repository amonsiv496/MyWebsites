			learning I graduated from Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas
			with a degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am
			currently working on personal projects that allows me to expand my
			skill set in the software development field. I do this by looking

			that. I want to start doing real world software applications to get
			started in my career as a software developer. I really want to work
			for GOOGLE, IBM, or Oracle one day when I meet the skill set
			criteria.</p>
